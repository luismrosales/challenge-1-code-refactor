# challenge-1-code-refactor


## acceptance criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
* WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
* WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
* WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## code refactor to acceptance criteria
## index.html
* the title was changed.
* added an "a" attribute to the "h1" in the header, this allows you tp go back to the main page when clicked.
* an "id" attribute was added to the div so when the link is clicked, it takes us to the desired section.
* an "alt" was added to the image, so it fits the acceptance criteria.
* a footer tag was added to the bottom to identify where the footer is.
## Css.style
* a color of pink was added to the "seo" span to add contrast and meet the acceptance criteria.
* styled the footer to look similar to the header
